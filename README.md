A loose Williams Robotron clone in Typescript

This is an attempt to reverse engineer the old Williams game Robotron in Typescript/Javascript. The compiled Javascript is included in the repo. The game will run as soon as you load the page in the browser without any demo screen. The sprite sheet used was something I found and I'm not sure of it's authenticity. I suspect it was from another version of Robotron, not the original arcade ROM which undoubtably had the sprites in pure data for performance and memory optimization. I have attempted to replicate the behaviors of the game elements as best I can. Controls are A-S-D-W to move and J-K-L-I to fire. I plan to add game pad support at some point.
